### Terminology
In the last section, we used a lot of Docker-specific jargon which might be confusing to some. So before we go further, let me clarify some terminology that is used frequently in the Docker ecosystem.

- Images - The blueprints of our application which form the basis of containers. In the demo above, we used the docker pull command to download the busybox image.
- Containers - Created from Docker images and run the actual application. We create a container using docker run which we did using the busybox image that we downloaded. A list of running containers can be seen using the docker ps command.
- Docker Daemon - The background service running on the host that manages building, running and distributing Docker containers. The daemon is the process that runs in the operating system to which clients talk to.
- Docker Client - The command line tool that allows the user to interact with the daemon. More generally, there can be other forms of clients too - such as Kitematic which provide a GUI to the users.
- Docker Hub - A registry of Docker images. You can think of the registry as a directory of all available Docker images. If required, one can host their own Docker registries and can use them for pulling images.

### Commands 

- docker ps — Lists running containers. Some useful flags include: -a / -all for all containers (default shows just running) and —-quiet /-q to list just their ids (useful for when you want to get all the containers).
- docker pull — Most of your images will be created on top of a base image from the Docker Hub registry. Docker Hub contains many pre-built images that you can pull and try without needing to define and configure your own. To download a particular image, or set of images (i.e., a repository), use docker pull.
- docker build — The docker build command builds Docker images from a Dockerfile and a “context”. A build’s context is the set of files located in the specified PATH or URL. Use the -t flag to label the image, for example docker build -t my_container . with the . at the end signalling to build using the currently directory.
- docker run — Run a docker container based on an image, you can follow this on with other commands, such as -it bash to then run bash from within the container. Also see Top 10 options for docker run — a quick reference guide for the CLI command. docker run my_image -it bash
- docker logs — Use this command to display the logs of a container, you must specify a container and can use flags, such as --follow to follow the output in the logs of using the program. docker logs --follow my_container
- docker volume ls — This lists the volumes, which are the preferred mechanism for persisting data generated by and used by Docker containers.
- docker rm — Removes one or more containers. docker rm my_container
- docker rmi — Removes one or more images. docker rmi my_image
- docker stop — Stops one or more containers. docker stop my_container stops one container, while docker stop $(docker ps -a -q) stops all running containers. A more direct way is to use docker kill my_container, which does not attempt to shut down the process gracefully first.
